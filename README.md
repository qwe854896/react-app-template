# react-app-template

It's a template for me to get more understanding on frontend development and for the future use.

## Introduction

This template is to build a frontend project with the following settings:

1. **Vite**, setting up the development enviroment (**React** + **TypeScript**).
2. **ESLint**, **Prettier**, and **StyleLint**, finding and fixing JS problems and regulating the same coding style.
3. **Husky**, setting up git hooks.
4. **Jest**, setting up tests.

## Prerequisites

You can find other alternatives of the following tools, but I think they make me feel comfortable.

- npm
  - I'm not sure if other package manager will be compatible now
- VS Code
  - For those dev extensions.

## Install

Clone this repo and execute `npm install`.

## Start

Watch out if there are any breaking changes in packages, or you can execute `npm run dev` after installation.
