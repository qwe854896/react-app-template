# react-app-template

It's a template for me to get more understanding on frontend development and for the future use.

## Introduction

This template is to build a frontend project with the following settings:

1. **Vite**, setting up the development enviroment (**React** + **TypeScript**).
2. **ESLint**, **Prettier**, and **StyleLint**, finding and fixing JS problems and regulating the same coding style.
3. **Husky**, setting up git hooks.
4. **Jest**, setting up tests.

## Prerequisites

I'm using the VS Code extension `Dev Containers`, which needs you to install:

- Docker
  - For creating container.
- VS Code
  - For those dev extensions.

## Install

Clone this repo by VS Code functions `Dev Containers: Clone Repository in ...`.

## Start

Watch out if there are any breaking changes in packages, or you can execute `yarn dev` after installation.

## Remarks

If you want to contribute to this repo, remember to modify the identity specified in `.devcontainer/postCreateCommand.sh`.
